- Creating simple Gluster cluster using Ansible


GlusterFS is a network-attached storage filesystem that allows you to pool storage resources of multiple machines. In turn, this lets you treat multiple storage devices that are distributed among many computers as a single, more powerful unit.GlusterFS also gives you the freedom to create different kinds of storage configurations, many of which are functionally similar to RAID levels. For instance, you can stripe data across different nodes in the cluster, or you can implement redundancy for better data availability.
